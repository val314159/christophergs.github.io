###Introduction

This is the first in a series of tutorial posts designed to help you start working with the Metawear platform using the Android API. The series is designed to be followed in order, with the complexity of posts (and the sample project) gradually growing as the series unfolds. Over the course of the series we will build a wearable app which detects XYZ.

*Some prior knowledge of programming is required, but I've tried to make this as accessible as possible, so no familiarity with Android is assumed. Note that I am not affiliated with the Mbient Labs team, so there may be mistakes. Pull requests are welcome!*

Here is the full series

1) Why use Metawear? (This Post)

2) Prerequisites and initial setup

3) Android setup 

4) Connecting to your board

5) Interacting with the board (Streaming) 

6) Dealing with data (Logging)

7) A better connection

8) Multiple sensors

9) Saving our data to CSV

10) Sending our data over HTTP

11) Capturing data for longer time durations

12) Processing on the board

Metawear provides a great way to prototype and develop Internet of Things (IoT) ideas. You can put Metawear sensors on objects, clothing, vehicles and many others, and then analyze the data that they stream back to you. What exactly you do with this data is up to you, but Metawear allows you to focus on the interpretation part, and takes care of the hardware. The technology is affordable (a typical sensor is less than $50), and there are well documented APIs for Android and iOS. For me, the Metawear sensors have been a great way to experiment with wearable technology ideas. This post series will show you how to get started and make good use of the technology.

>The MetaWear platform provides a one-stop shop for wearable sensor solutions. Our goal is to completely eliminate the need for product developers to build hardware or write firmware code.
