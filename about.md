	<section class="about-text">

		<p>I'm 28, from London, and have been living in Beijing for the past two years.

		One of my favorite quotes is from Carl Friedrich Gauss:

		"It is not knowledge, but the act of learning which grants the greatest enjoyment. When I have clarified and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again ..."

		This is why I love Computer Science, especially software development: I'm constantly learning. There are so many fascinating areas to explore. For me, it is an amazing source of enjoyment. 

		<br><br>

		I'm a full stack developer. I really enjoy writing code in Python, and co-organize the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Beijing-Python/">Beijing Python meetup.</a>  

		I recently built a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1489178162/rolltec-grappling-the-first-wearable-made-for-grap/">prototype wearable</a> which has
		allowed me to develop my understanding of machine learning with scikit-learn and the scientific python stack.

		I've also recently built a customer-facing web application using React. I'll definitely be using this more, as React is brilliant.

		<br><br>

		When I'm not learning about Computer Science, I also like to write about personal finance over on a blog I run with a few friends: <a href="http://thelifelifebalance.com">Life-Life Balance</a> (the blog is powered by <a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a>, one of my favorite open source projects). 

		<br><br>

		I also enjoy reading and writing fiction. My Science Fiction short story "Bodyware", which explores the future of wearable technology, won the <a href="http://www.albedo1.com/2015/07/16/aeon-award-2014-winners/">2014 Aeon Science Fiction Prize.</a> 


		<p>Now you know a bit about what makes me tick, and what I can offer. If you have anything you'd like to discuss, please feel free to drop me an email at
