	<h3 class="text-center">A British developer currently based in Beijing.</h3>

	<br>

	<p>I'm 27, from London, and have been living in Beijing for the past 18 months.

	One of my favorite quotes is from mighty Carl Friedrich Gauss:

	"It is not knowledge, but the act of learning which grants the greatest enjoyment. When I have clarified and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again ..."

	This is why I love Computer Science, especially software development: I'm constantly learning. There are so many fascinating areas to explore. For me, it is an amazing source of enjoyment. 

	<br><br>

	I'm currently spending a lot of time improving my Python skills, which is in large part due to my interest in Machine Learning. 

	I've also begun exploring wearable development, which has been stimulated by my interest in the Internet of Things. 

	<br><br>

	When I'm not learning about Computer Science, I also like to write about personal finance over on a blog I run with a few friends: <a href="http://thelifelifebalance.com">Life-Life Balance</a> (the blog is powered by <a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a>, one of my favorite open source projects). 

	<br><br>

	I also enjoy writing fiction. My Science Fiction short story "Bodyware", which explores the future of wearable technology, was recenctly shortlisted for the Aeon Science Fiction Prize. You can <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/Bodyware_Short_Story_by_Christopher_Samiullah.pdf">read the full story here.</a></p>


	<p>Now you know a bit about what makes me tick, and what I can offer. If you have anything you'd like to discuss, please feel free to drop me an email at
